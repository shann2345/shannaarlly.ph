<br><br>
The volcano with its surrounding landscape was declared a national park on July 20, 1938, the first in the nation. It was reclassified as a natural park and renamed the Mayon Volcano Natural Park in 2000.

<h2>2. Donsol Whale Shark Interaction Center</h2>
<div class="shann">
<img src="Picture/Donsol.png">
<p>- Donsol is one of the few places in the world that guarantees a fun (and responsible) whale shark sighting in the country. To compare this experience to the same wildlife activity in Oslob, Donsol whale sharks are in their natural environment where boats do not overcrowd nor force-feed them. They are also closely monitored by the local government and only allow seasonal sightings and interactions from November to July to ensure its long-term sustainability.<br><br><br>Situated in the province of Sorsogon, Donsol is now a popular hub of tourism that houses the Whale Shark Interaction Eco-Tourism Project initiative of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). Like many other touristy locations in the Bicol Region, the municipality is leading the way for sustainable tourism by involving the general public to discover and meet the gentle giants of the Philippine sea. </p>

<h2>6. Basilica of Our Lady of Peñafrancia</h2>
<div class="shann">
<img src="Picture/white.png">
<p>- Our Lady of Peñafrancia is an image of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Philippines. It is one of the most venerated Marian images in Asia—the patroness of the Bicol Region, colloquially referred to as "Ina". It's a replica of the Virgen de la Peña de Francia. The icon is enshrined at the Minor Basilica of Our Lady of Peñafrancia in Naga City. Every September, the image is given a 9-day novena and the Peñafrancia Festival is celebrated in its honor.
<br><br>
On May 13, 1920, Pope Benedict XV issued a decree of canonical consecration for the image. The coronation was carried out on September 20, 1924. On 3 December 2015, a mosaic image of the Virgin Mary under this title was officially enshrined at the Vatican Gardens. The ceremony was attended by Philippine president Benigno Aquino III, who unveiled the image.</p>

<h2>7. Sumlang Lake</h2>
<div class="shann">
<img src="Picture/lake.png">
<p>- If you're looking to witness 360-degree views of Mayon Volcano without the hassle of tourist crowds, Sumlang Lake is your safest bet. A calm and relaxing destination to travel around, this enchanting attraction boasts an unobstructed panorama of the world-renowned conically shaped volcano.
<br><br>
However, this atmospheric beauty wasn't always the stunning landmark tourists visit today. The lake was once pervaded by water lilies, volcanic debris, and filthy waters for years until the residents held a bayanihan (communal work) initiative to rehabilitate the 14-hectare body of water. The effort has paid off; it is now a famous rendezvous for couples and small group tours. 
<br><br>
Hidden in the outskirts of Legazpi, the lake sits on the Albay Agri Ethno Eco Village in Camalig town and is accessible via jeep from the city center. Don’t forget to try riding on a traditional bamboo raft while enjoying the beautiful scenery Albay has to offer. It's also home to Socorro's Lakeside Restaurant and Grill, one of the best restaurants in Albay.</p>

<h2>8. Daraga Church </h2>
<div class="shann">
<img src="Picture/ALBAY.png">
<p>- IDaraga Church sits on top of a hill overlooking Mount Mayon Volcano and is considered a religious landmark in Legazpi, Albay. A must-visit for first-time visitors in Bicol's regional center, walking down its halls feels like a short journey through history, religion, and design. 
<br><br>
The church was originally named Nuestra Señora de la Porteria (Our Lady of the Gate) Parish Church and first established as a settlement by people relocating from Cagsawa after a major eruption of the Mayon Volcano. In 1772, the Spanish government granted permission to build the religious structure with the intention of fostering a new community in the south of Cagsawa.
<br><br>
The present church was built in Barangay Santa Maria under the orchestration of Franciscan priests in 1773 as a replacement for the old Cagsawa Church after it was devastated by a series of volcanic eruptions.</p>
